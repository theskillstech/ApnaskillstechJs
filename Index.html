	//What is the basic concept of JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. //
//JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It achieves this by adding new HTML elements while modifying existing ones. Many coders enhance web development skills using JavaScript to create user-friendly and interactive websites.
 // 
// In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript. //
